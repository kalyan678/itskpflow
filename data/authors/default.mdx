From delivering newspapers to leading data science teams, Kalyan career has always been fuelled by curiosity and grit. Iâ€™m a hands-on leader who believes in clarity, balance, and keeping it real. My focus is on turning messy data into actionable insights helping industries solve real problems through machine learning, AI and analytics.

Iâ€™m all about simplifying complexity. Whether itâ€™s guiding my team to focus on impact over perfection or making sure technical work aligns with business goals, I always strive for practical solutions. But leading isnâ€™t just about hitting targets. Itâ€™s also about protecting my team from burnout, mentoring them to grow, and setting realistic expectations with stakeholders.

Beyond work, Iâ€™m deeply involved in the open-source community, especially in Python and data science. I started as a volunteer at [HydPy](https://www.hydpy.org/) and grew into leadership roles, from leading the community locally to being a chairperson for national and regional conferences like [PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/) and [PyConf Hyderabad](https://pyconfhyd.org/). My journey didnâ€™t stop there, Iâ€™ve contributed to these communities on a global scale and love sharing knowledge through talks at tech conferences and educational events.

When Iâ€™m not working or speaking at tech events, youâ€™ll probably find me lifting weights at the gym, exploring new places, or binge-watching movies (including the cheesy ones, no shame!). Lifeâ€™s too short to take yourself too seriously, right? ðŸ˜Š
