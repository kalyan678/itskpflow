# Introduction

Over the past two years, I’ve had the incredible opportunity to serve as an Advisor for Cohorts 3 and 4 of the KaggleX BIPOC Fellowship Program. 
This initiative is close to my heart, as it focuses on empowering early-career data scientists from historically marginalized communities, 
offering them a platform to learn, grow, and succeed in the field of AI and data science.

# Guiding Future Leaders in Data Science

My core mission as an advisor was simple yet impactful:
to support budding data scientists in building real-time, cutting-edge applications, thereby strengthening their technical expertise and preparing them for career opportunities in the tech world.

Through regular seminars, weekly check-ins, and hands-on project guidance, I worked with passionate and talented individuals who were eager to explore and create. Watching them progress from curious learners to confident professionals has been one of the most rewarding parts of this journey.

# Building an Inclusive Learning Space

A key aspect of my role was to foster inclusivity and representation within the KaggleX community. I strongly believe that diversity in voices brings diversity in ideas and that’s exactly what this program nurtures.

I actively supported BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) participants by creating a safe, encouraging environment where everyone could express themselves, ask questions, and grow without hesitation.

# Mentorship That Goes Beyond Projects

One of my proudest contributions was helping mentees design tailored learning paths aligned with their unique career goals. We worked together on not just improving technical skills but also shaping career roadmaps whether it was preparing for job interviews, building portfolios, or contributing to open-source communities.

I also made it a point to support mentees beyond my assigned group, stepping in to assist others with project doubts, brainstorming ideas, and reviewing submissions. The sense of camaraderie and collaboration truly set this experience apart.

# A Humbling Recognition

In 2023, during Cohort 3, I was deeply honored to be recognized among the Top 10 Mentors Globally for my contributions. This recognition wasn’t just a personal milestone it reflected the meaningful relationships and community impact we had built together

I shared my reflections on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itskpflow_kagglex-bipoc-raisingequity-activity-7129809117698813953--yJ9?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAASyU24BaT9ImaEr0_eWeTd3p_JBwo6LwVo)
, expressing how grateful I was for the chance to contribute to a movement focused on equity, education, and empowerment in data science.

# Looking Ahead

My involvement with the KaggleX BIPOC Fellowship continues, and I remain committed to helping the next generation of data scientists find their voice, build confidence, and create change. This program has reminded me that mentorship is more than guidance it’s about belief, belonging, and building bridges for those who deserve every opportunity to thrive.

Thank you, KaggleX, for creating this space. And to all the brilliant minds I’ve mentored keep dreaming big, keep building boldly.

Stay tuned for more reflections and resources as I continue to grow alongside this wonderful community.
